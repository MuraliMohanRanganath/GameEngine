The Game is called UFO killer.
The player controls the rocket ship using the keys 'A' and 'D' to move horizontally, 'W' to launch the rocket.
There are UFOs on top of the screen which are destroyed when the rocket ship hits the UFO.
As the time increases the UFOs move faster.
If the Rocket ship sucessfully hits or misses the position of the rocket is reset to the initial position.
